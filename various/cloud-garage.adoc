== Troubleshooting

If you can ping a host on windows but not on the sandbox
Check that there is no overlaps on the networks

route -n

If Docker is on the same network that the target one, we can fix it by changin it's ip
sudo vim /etc/docker/daemon.json

{
  "default-address-pools":
  [
    {"base":"172.33.0.0/16", "size":24}
  ]
}

sudo systemctl restart docker
